Dear reader,

Picture the world of the future as it's described in science fiction: flying cars sweep you away at the touch of a button, robot scouts comb the galaxy for more resources, and ai doctors that can extend your life indefinitely.  The unifying fabric of the world of the future is technology, and technology necessitates electrical engineering.

Many people hold the misconception that electrical engineers either design electronics or work in power plants.  In fact, electrical engineers do much more. In my mind there are 7 major fields within electrical engineering and many more closely related disciplines.  The major fields include power, microelectronics, circuits, control, signal processing, radio-frequency engineering, and telecommunications.  Smaller fields and related disciplines range from quantum computing to bio-electronics. One things I love about about electrical engineering is how broad and far reaching the field is.  For more information about the different fields within electrical engineering, check out the [wikipedia section on electrical engineering subfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering#Subfields).

Every school's EE program is different but here is my experience as an undergrad at Penn State.  Freshmen and sophomore year include taking core engineering classes along with your first EE classes.  I recommend truly learning the concepts taught in these classes (especially math), as they form the foundation for the rest of your degree.  Yes, that means paying attention in calculus and differential equations.  Junior year is where things pick up and you get into the meat of your degree.  The majority of your core EE courses are taken during this year, some of which will be challenging.  My junior year was filled with many weekends spent working on projects, cursing under my breath in the lab.  The classes I found most challenging were electromagnetics and nanoelectronics.  Your experience may vary.  Senior year typically includes finishing your core classes, doing a senior design project, and taking EE electives.  The electives taken during your junior and senior year allow you to specialize in one or more area(s) of electrical engineering.  I recommend deciding which core class you like the most and take electives in that area.  The journey to obtain a degree in electrical engineering may seem long and challenging but, if you have the right mind and determination, electrical engineering is a very rewarding major.

Coming out of school and into industry you learn that the problems you have at work are not like problems from textbooks.  Also, much of the knowledge needed at work is learned on the job.  That may make it sound like getting a degree is a waste but that is definitly not the case.  What a degree offers are the tools and problem solving skills necessary to be a successful engineer.  With that in mind, in your undergrad I would focus more on concepts and how to approach problem solving and less on memorizing equations and all the nitty gritty details a professor might ask on an exam.

Another thing I have taken to heart since graduating is the importance of architectures and systems thinking.  Many courses take too narrow a view and forget to pull back and look at how everything ties together.  During your undergrad, take projects one step further and consider how things could be designed so that they are testable, modular, and scalable.  Read about systems engineering and architectures.  A quick thought experiment or writeup on how to architect your project will go a long way toward making you a more impactful engineer.  This may not make sense in the context of a simple project but imagine if the project was more complex, or a piece in a larger system.

I'm confident that electrical engineering will thrive in the years to come.  I hope that the lessons I learned as a young electrical engineer help you in your journey.

Best of luck,

Joe Hutchinson
