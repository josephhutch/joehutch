Dear reader,



What is electrical engineering including the differnt disciplines.

Electrical engineering is about so much more than just electricity and circuits.  Electrical engineers design satelites that communicate with our phones using elctromagnetic waves.  Electrical engineers 

What is it like going through school.

Admitedly, electrical engineering is a very challenging major.  The coursework relies on subjects that many students struggle with, namely math, physics, and logic.  All schools' EE programs are different but here is my experience.  Freshmen and sophmore year include taking core engineering classes along with your first EE classes.  I recommend truely learning the concepts taught in all these classes, as they form the foundation for the rest of your degree.  Yes, that means paying attention in calculus and differential equations.  Junior year is where things pick up and you get into the meat of your degree.  The majority of your core EE courses are taken during this year, some of which will be challenging.  .  The classes I found most challenging were electromagnetics and nanoelectronics.  Senior year typically includes finishing your core classes, doing a senior design project, and taking EE electives.  The electives taken during your junior and senior year allow you to specialize in one or more area(s) of electrical engineering.

What kind of jobs you can expect to get.

How does EE fit into the future.

Best of luck in your journey,
