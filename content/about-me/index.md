Hi ðŸ‘‹ Joe here.  Welcome, and thanks for visiting.

I'm a problem solver. My chosen tools are software and my computer.. and occasionally a soldering iron or multimeter.  I've worked on self-driving golf mowers, an IoT vision system, a picture based calorie tracking app (giving "phone eats first" a whole new meaning), and an image inpainting app that can restore a corrupted smile.  I studied electrical engineering at Penn State and at NC State, where I focused on computer vision and machine learning at a master's level.  Currently, I do research and development at John Deere.

A lot of my time is spent reading and thinking about how technology will drive the future.  My convictions here give me great hope and concern.  For one, I'm certain the future will be forged with data and processing.  I also believe our algorithms will transcend us.  This is humanity's destiny.  I aim to have a say, however small, in how the unstoppable force of technology is realized.

I'm also very interested in consciousness, the concept of the self, and meditation.  The past is a memory, the future is a thought, and the present offers the only opportunity to live.  I live by this motto to be more available for the people I love.

This site exists as a creative outlet and a place to share my perspective.  The other place you can find me online is GitHub at [josephhutch](https://github.com/josephhutch/).
