Reading is an incredible process.  As our eyes scan a page, our brain stitches together symbols to see words, form ideas, build characters, develop feelings, and even construct entire worlds.  I read a lot of articles but in the past few years I haven't set aside the time to read many books.  This year I'm inviting authors into my life to lay out a more nuanced argument, give me a deeper look at the people I find most inspiring, or share a expansive, captivating story.

## Selected Thoughts

This book was required reading for my Managing New Product Creation class as we explore design thinking.  I have really grown to appreciate design thinking and I thought this book did a great job of explaining what it is and how to use it.
