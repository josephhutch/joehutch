I'm surprised my reading list was so short this year since the books I read really dominated my head space.  *Why We Sleep*, in particular, was one I couldn't stop talking about.  Here's the full list...

### Books

- *Dune* by Frank Herbert
- *Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams* by Matthew Walker

### AudioBooks

- *The Art of Living* by Thich Nhat Hanh
- *Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention--and How to Think Deeply Again* by Johann Hari
- *Measure What Matters: OKRs: The Simple Idea that Drives 10x Growth* by John Doerr
