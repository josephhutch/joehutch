The torrid Arizona sun heats my neck, while my soul  
basks in the majesty of the warm rock below.  A small sea of air  
reveals layers of earth from lifetimes ago.  What eyes don’t remember  
and a photograph can’t capture makes the canyon surrounding  
 me appear unreal and supernatural.

A trail scarred by the clench of metal cleats and poles guides  
me through mother nature’s finest work.  Millions of years of sculpting  
has proved every second and still a work in progress!  

As the cultured dust under my boots changes from a rusty red powder  
to a sand finer than flour, the desert makes up for the dry death  
above.  Indian springs feed an ecosystem walled off  
from a world of compromised purity.

At night, the brilliant sky above and the tranquil sound of a stream nearby lull  
me to sleep after the long journey.  An attempt to count every gleaming star  
would be disrupted by the morning sun rising over the rim.  A hike to the bottom  
is the only way to appreciate a canyon so grand.

Joe Hutchinson, 2014
