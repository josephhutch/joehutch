Hi. I'm Joe Hutchinson and this is my blog.

I'm a part time master's student at NC State University and full time engineer at John Deere. My focus is on robotics and artificial intelligence. In my free time I enjoy watching sci-fi films, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with friends.

You can find me on GitHub at [josephhutch](https://github.com/josephhutch/)
